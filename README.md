# ðŸ”  Welcome!

We are devoted game lovers who had an idea to come up with a community with our own hosted dedicated servers, which include ArmA 3, FiveM, Minecraft, and more to come! We aim to have players around the world available to play at a moment's notice, whether it's on our servers or any other game in general, we are a community that accepts people from all walks of life! Everyone will be welcome at Vanguard, and we can't wait to meet and make some memories with you guys!

As well as this we welcome content creators which can include Youtubers, Streamers, and even Modders. The best way to join us is by joining our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Vgmmt3C).
