# Vehicle Rental

Upon joining our server you will have very little apart from the clothes on your back and two items in your possession. If you want to get from A to B instead of walking everywhere then Vehicle Rental is your best choice for now unless you have the expenses for a Taxi.

Use the chat and type /postal xxxx to find the NPC shown in the image below and there you will be able to rent a cheap car for a limited time, if you have more money then go for the higher tier ones that are also available.&#x20;
