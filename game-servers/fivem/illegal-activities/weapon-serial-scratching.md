# Weapon Serial Scratching

If you have a weapon that has been used in an illegal activity such as a murder or robbery of some kind then you can make it harder for the (Law Enforcement) to know you were involved by scratching off the weapon serial. There is a location shown below where if you go there then you can do such for a small fee and as long as you have the right tool.
