# Employment

### Beginning Your Career

Upon joining **Vanguard RP** you will be unemployed with 2 basic items, an **ID Card** and a **Phone** and if you wish to further progress in the game you will need to choose wisely between either getting a legitimate job or living a life of crime.  &#x20;

If you wish to get employed from the start then you will first need to make your way to the **City Hall** where you will find the NPC you need to speak to.

{% hint style="info" %}
_To easily find the **City Hall** you can use the chat command **/postal 8155** which will then give you the direct waypoint._
{% endhint %}

Upon speaking to the NPC you will be given two options, (**Identity**) and (**Employment**). Identity is where you will get your ID Card & Licenses if you were to lose them or have been granted new ones.
